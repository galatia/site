## Hacking Luxury: Rethink Your Lifestyle Assumptions

1. having a home — travel
2. job (high paying then leave early; passive income; freelance)
3. having stuff; what do you actually need to be happy

### Home is Where You Hang Your Hat 
I get restless when I'm in the same place too long. My surroundings feel too familiar, and it's hard to stay motivated to do any particular thing because I feel like I could do it later. When my partner had a well-paying tech job, he used to take me on the occasional small trip to Portland or Boston or even once Hawaii to explore or visit friends. But traveling like this is not at all sustainable with our current budget.

Now we're nomadic. Instead of paying rent in a fixed location, we move on to a new city every month or two, and our rent is for Airbnb flats. A big cost is how expensive the city is, so we avoid the popular ones, instead of sacrificing on basic amenities or neighborhood. Instead, we find nice flats near a beach or park in a location that functions less as a tourist destination. 

Getting from place to place might seem expensive, but our transportation costs come primarily from that, and not taxis or daily public transportation around town. We walk everywhere[^1]—we pick Airbnb flats that are close to everything we need. And when we do move on every month or two, a criteria for choosing our next location is whether it's cheap enough to get to from where we currently are[^2].
