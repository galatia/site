<!--Hacking Luxury: Feel Rich While Living Cheaply
============-->

Conventional wisdom suggests that if you need to live frugally[^1], you should make each purchasing choice proportional to your total budget. For example, if you're keeping expenses low, you shouldn't buy the priciest bottle of olive oil in the store, get high-quality bluetooth speakers, or wear $50 shirts. 

[^1]: If you are living paycheck to paycheck and literally every dollar counts, the advice in this post probably isn't relevant to you. I'm assuming that you have some wiggle room in your budget and that your ability to continue supporting yourself doesn't rely on every possible savings optimization.

Or should you?

My budget each month for myself and my partner is about $1,000 for rent, $400 each for food, $200 for transportation, and $500 for everything else. We've actually been averaging about 20% less, and even less for food. And we've been breaking all of those implicit no-no's of cheap living. 

Conventional wisdom about living cheaply might apply to you if you're already struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. On the opposite end, if you have lots of disposable income, you likely don't care about living more cheaply. However, if your financial situation is more similar to ours (even if your budget is substantially higher or lower), it might be beneficial to reconsider how you decide to allocate your funds.

## Efficiency in Saving

Living cheaply is generally not considered much fun. Saving money is draining and frustrating. Every purchasing decision that results in an option you like less for the sake of lower costs, also [costs you willpower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). If you feel like you're always saving and never splurging on yourself, you might feel less valuable as a person, or you might crack and go on an unintentional shopping spree one day. However, if you ignore conventional wisdom, it can be possible to keep your expenses low while tricking yourself into feeling well-off[^abundance].

[^abundance]: Another way of thinking about this is in terms of cultivating an abundance mindset. If you're always trying to save money, it's easy to be stuck in a scarcity mindset, which can greatly affect your general happiness and energy levels.

### 1. Cut down on your largest expenses
It is more efficient to save money by cutting down on the largest costs and not worrying much about the rest. If an expense is already low (like a box of teas), saving 50% each time might add up, but not as much as 50% savings on a larger expense, like rent. This is a difference on the order of *tens* of dollars versus *hundreds* or *thousands* of dollars each month. While using coupons is considered a thrifty thing to do, they likely won't save you that much compared to the effort of finding and using them.

Some of the biggest categories of expenses can be housing, food, and cars. If you're living in a city with generally high rent (like NYC or SF) or have a luxurious house/apartment, you could automatically save a lot every month just by *moving someone cheaper*. If you eat out a large proportion of the time, *learning to cook* could could cut down food expenses by hundreds of dollars each month. If you own a car, try *ditching it entirely* in favor of walking, public transportation, and the occasional rental and taxi. Look at the biggest categories of expenses in your life and cut down on those, and stop sweating the small things.  

### 2. Regularly splurge in small ways
Let's take this a step further. Don't just *not worry* about splurging on small luxuries; *embrace* it. It feels much nicer to save on the large expenses if you regularly treat yourself.

#### Groceries
I love fresh food. I pretty much refuse to eat anything prepared already in the package. Since eating well is a priority for me, but eating out a lot is a big expense, we cook. Neither of us are great chefs, but it's much nicer for me to have a freshly cooked meal almost all the time than it is to switch between frozen food and eating out. 

At the grocery store, I buy basically whatever unprepared items I want. Olive oil is a big staple in my diet, so I recently splurged on a $13 bottle, and want to try an even nicer one next. If I have all the ingredients I want, my desire to eat out is greatly decreased.

#### Music
My partner and I have somewhat snobby music tastes and are mildly audiophilic. Put another way, jazz (especially with complicated bass) doesn't sound super great on phone or computer speakers. We used to go to concerts sometimes in SF, but we cut that out of our lifestyle. 

 So are we doomed now to poor music quality? Nope! We splurged on good-quality travel bluetooth speakers (the [Denon Envaya Mini](http://www.denon.co.uk/uk/product/bluetooth/bluetoothspeakers/envayamini)), and now we can feel almost like we have a sound stage whenever we want. Listening to Brad Mehldau or Avishai Cohen on these speakers is fully engaging, and I don't feel as much of a need to seek out live entertainment anymore.

### 3. Generally don't compromise on quality

Buying good-quality speakers instead of sticking to laptop speakers might be seen as unfrugal. But while the upfront cost (~$150) was somewhat large for a luxury item, they'll last a long time and we get enormous use out of them.

If you can afford slightly higher upfront costs, it's more useful to analyze costs stretched out over the projected lifetime of the item. It is often cheaper over the long run to get a decent quality version of the item you need in the first place, than to have to keep paying for replacements or even small upgrades in quality to satisfy your desire. In some cases, having a higher quality version of an item can also replace having more items of lower quality.

Be careful not to use this as an excuse to spend a lot on high-quality luxuries that aren't fulfilling a strong *long-term* desire. Even if something might last a long while, if it doesn't *continue* to make you feel good throughout the lifetime of the item, it's probably not worth it. The point of splurging on luxuries is to make you *feel* well-off, so if that feeling is only at the initial point of purchase, it's pretty inefficient. If this feels like a hard balance for you, try waiting a month every time you want a luxury item to see if you still really want it after a cooling-off period.
 
#### Luggage
My partner has had a Tom Bihn bag (the [Aeronaut](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0906.html)) for a couple years, and it shows absolutely no sign of wear yet. When I needed to get a good carry-on bag, I splurged on a similar Tom Bihn bag. On the other hand, we've also been using a cheap rolling luggage, and it's fallen apart quite quickly with a gaping hole in the outer layer, so we'll need to replace it pretty soon before it falls apart entirely. 
 
#### Wardrobe
I used to buy a pair of $10-15 black leggings every few weeks because they wore out very quickly. Finally I splurged on a more expensive pair, and it's already lasted me two years. 

Our wardrobes now mostly consist of black, versatile merino wool clothes. They work well in a large range of situations and climates, and they don't wear out or get smelly as fast. They also cost more upfront than I used to spend on clothes, but with that quality, I imagine they'll last quite a while before getting even small holes. 

I don't miss having a larger range of options, because I *enjoy* wearing my merino wool; the material feels nice on my skin, and I still look good (at least according to my partner, that is).

## Experience Abundance

Living cheaply doesn't need to mean worrying about how cheap every individual purchase is, or whether you got on sale. What's more important is the absolute amount of money you save for each purchasing choice, and the extent to which it affects your feeling of abundance. You might feel guilty about small luxuries if you need to save (especially if you're paying student debt), but if you're staying within your overall budget, you're not actually doing anything wrong[^1]. If you feel abundance, it will be easier to stick to a more modest lifestyle. 

[^1]: If you need to, you should lower your total budget instead of limiting what you can spend it on.

It can take time to get used to these new criteria for saving without overcorrecting, but if you have a good feedback loop between your budget and actual expenditure, you might be surprised by how many small luxuries you can get away with. It migh feel dissonant at first, but that's because you're adapting to a more abundant mindset.
