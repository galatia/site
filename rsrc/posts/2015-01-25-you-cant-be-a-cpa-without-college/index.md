<!--You Can’t Be a CPA Without College
============-->

Like, you can’t even take the test to see if you’re qualified.

I had to look into tax law a bunch recently[^tax]. At first it was very much a chore, and then it started actually being fun once I had more of a sense for what the IRS cares about. I’m generally open to ideas for potential careers[^lives], so I wondered what I would need to do to become a Certified Public Accountant.

[^tax]: tl;dr as a Thiel Fellow and nomad, among other complicating things, my tax situation is complex.

Turns out, there is no way to become a CPA without a bachelor’s. It used to be a thing that you didn’t need a college degree, but now every state requires it[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6] (from as early as even 1983 in Florida, and many keep raising the requirements, with a minimum of 150 semester hours, and in some also experience under a CPA). I left college after the first day of classes, so apparently this means I can’t be a CPA, even if I could ace the exam, until these laws are reformed.

But there are some hacks around the college requirement for this area of work, if you don’t care too much about the title “CPA.” You could represent clients in Tax Court as a non-attorney if you pass the Tax Court Exam, without needing a college degree. Or, if you become an Enrolled Agent, you are also considered a Federally Authorized Tax Practitioner, so you can be a tax preparer and represent taxpayers to the IRS. All you seem to need is to pass the test and do some continuing professional education every three years. But as an enrolled agent, you’re not actually an accountant and you’re not certified to do specifically accounting things, including attesting for an audit that financial statements are correct.

Alternatively, since “accountant” (as opposed to Certified Public Accountant) is not a protected term in many places (except in, for example, California, or Texas if you’re a Texas resident), you could maybe just forgo certification. But this feels like a lame concession.

Sometimes I think the era of needing to go to college is almost over, but I guess I’m biased by caring mostly about tech/science, where these things are more flexible. I hope other fields grow up soon.
