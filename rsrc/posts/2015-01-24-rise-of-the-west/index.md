<!--Rise of the West
============-->

I recently found this...thing...in a folder called "10th grade" while going through old files on my laptop. Apparently I was once a 10th grader who wrote pretentious, obnoxiously long essays on stuff like historiography. At some point I think I must have gotten bored writing because I also found an outline that goes further, and it ends awkwardly. So, um, read at your peril.


Introduction
------------

A consensus has emerged among historians and other social scientists that the West is, or at least was for a number of centuries, the dominant power in the world. However, this is as far as the agreement goes; their explanations of the causes of this phenomenon and their prognosis for the future are the subject of lively and continuing debate.

Max Weber, one of the earliest scholars to study this question, is famous for his view that the West’s superiority is inherent, the product of “European rationality.” On the other hand, Karl Marx understood the West’s superiority to be a function of the shameful economic exploitation that is the key characteristic of capitalism. Because of national pride and the desire to justify colonialism and imperialism, historians in the early 20th century tended to view world history from a Eurocentric vantage point, with “tunnel vision” (coined by Blaut 1993): the West is modern and superior and this will diffuse throughout the rest of the world. These Eurocentric arguments about the inevitability of Western superiority evolved from Weber’s racism to more socially acceptable cultural and environmental determinism. In the post-colonial period of the ’60s and ’70s, some neo-Marxist historians, notably Immanuel Wallerstein, developed a “world systems” theory, framing the rise of the West, capitalism, and Western expansion in a harsh light. Other modern historians, critical of Eurocentrism and dedicated to disproving European superiority, look at the West’s rise through more global eyes, claiming, instead, that Europe’s rise to power relied heavily on previous advances of other societies and was unmerited and certainly not due to inherent superiority.

Recently, historians seeking a more balanced view shift the timing of the West’s rise to the 1800s, arguing that, prior to the Industrial Revolution, the East and the West were more similar than different and highlighting the unexpectedness of the West’s rise, which was contingent on many factors throughout the world. Some modern scholars still view Europe favorably, but they avoid Eurocentrism by claiming that the rise of the West was due to European innovations themselves and not European culture. While some of these necessary innovations relied upon previous Eastern ones, Europe alone rose to power because it had the unique combination of advances. This shift in focus from the innovators to innovations allows for the understanding that the West’s superiority was certainly not inevitable and may easily change in the future.

Due to historical events of the 20th century and the cultural shift that they provoked, the general trend in scholarship on the rise of the West has evolved from complete Eurocentric “tunnel vision” that posits an inherent Western superiority to a more balanced and neutral view of history that recognizes the unexpectedness of many events, and this shift, in turn, has influenced scholars’ predictions about the future of the West.


Origins of Eurocentrism
-----------------------

Belief in the inherent superiority of Europe has been around in various forms ever since Europe began to be understood as a distinct place by its inhabitants in early Medieval times, according to the notable critic of Eurocentrism James Morris Blaut (Blaut 2000, 4). Eurocentrism, as Blaut defines it, is the belief that Europeans, or, more loosely, “the West,” “has had some unique historical advantage, some special quality of race or culture or environment or mind or spirit, which gives this human community a permanent superiority over all other communities, at all times in history and down to the present...Europe eternally advances, progress, modernizes” (Blaut 1993, 1). In short, Europe is the perpetual “good-guy” protagonist in the story of world history.

That European scholars appraise Europe as the best is unsurprising; the time and place scholars live in tends to strongly impact their perspective of history. In the inaugural issue of *The Journal of World History*, the historian William McNeill, reflecting on *The Rise of the West*, his Eurocentric *magnum opus*, 25 years after its publication, remarks, “No historian can deny that his views of the past reflect experiences of his own time, interacting with a tradition of learning that, in turn, bears all the marks of the times and places in which it grew” (McNeill 1990, 3). In *Telling the Truth About History*, Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob claim that ethnocentrism is not exclusive to Europeans and that it derives largely from nationalism. “The engine of nationalism drove historians to place their countries—and by extension their fellow citizens—into the larger design of world history,” they assert. “Building the nation became an absolute value, and history’s contribution to that effort was assumed unreflectively” (Appleby et. al. 1994, 241). The authors seek to claim that Eurocentric scholarship is not true history, as they attribute to it an ulterior motive where it should ideally be objective and unbiased. 

Not only does historical scholarship incorporate ethnocentrism, according to the Islamic scholar and world historian Marshall Hodgson, but also maps reflect and reinforce the West’s views of self-superiority:

> The Westernist image of world history...is reinforced by our usual maps of the world, which put the Western countries on a much larger scale than the others [and it] is reinforced in a thousand subtle ways, intentional and unintentional, by historical scholarship. If one reads a ‘history of technology’ it is a history of Western technology, and inventions within the West and introduction from beyond the West are treated as exactly the same sort of ‘progress,’ and little effort is made to distinguish time or place outside of the limited Western area. (Hodgson 1993, 92)

Long before the heyday of Eurocentrism in the first half of the 20th century, Hodgson argues, ordinary human egocentrism influenced the perception of historians so that they noticed Western advances, while non-Western innovations remained invisible to them.

However, Hodgson explains, this is not unique to the West; in a chapter entitled, “In the center of the map nations see themselves as the hub of history,” he describes how a European map that the sixteenth century Italian missionary Matteo Ricci brought to China to show the discovery of the New World “offended them.” On Ricci’s European map, which split the Earth down the Pacific rather than the Atlantic, China was at the right-hand edge instead of the center of the map; the Chinese believed that the Temple of Heaven at Peking, the Emperor’s capital, was the exact center of the Earth. Even though Chinese scholars in the Middle Ages knew that, mathematically, China could not be the center, nevertheless, “for sober historians, the pivotal fact of human history was the condition of the great Chinese empire.” Westerners, too, insist on maps that highlight their significance; the United States is frequently placed in the center “even at the cost of splitting a continent in two.” Hodgson concludes, “The temptation not only to put one’s land in the center of the map, but one’s own people in the center of history, seems to be universal” (Hodgson 1993, 29). China, Europe, and the United States all view history and the world from the perspective that they are the center of it.

However, Blaut argues, Eurocentrism differs from other forms of ethnocentrism in that its beliefs are about empirical reality and factual history; Eurocentric views are often seen as *objectively* true (Blaut 1993, 9). Blaut describes textbooks’ general outline of the main tenets of world history in its path towards modernity: 1) the Neolithic Revolution, occurring in the Middle East, 2) early cities and organized institutions, also in the Middle East, 3) the Age of Metals, beginning in the Middle East, and the “Iron Age” originating in Europe, 4) monotheism, emerging first in the Middle East, 5) democracy, developed in Ancient Greece, in Europe, 6) the sciences and humanities, also in Ancient Greece, 7) class society and struggle, appearing first in the Greco-Roman era, 8) bureaucracy, law, etc. of the Roman Empire, 9) feudalism, in Europe, 10) advanced European technology in the Middle Ages, 11) the modern state, invented by Europeans, 12) capitalism, also invented by Europeans, 13) great discoveries by “uniquely ‘venturesome’” European explorers, and 14) Europe’s invention of industry and the Industrial Revolution (Blaut 1993, 7-8). These events and innovations, while mostly true, ignore and give no credit to the non-European world. Blaut calls this “tunnel history,” a view “through a tunnel of time whose walls were the boundaries of Greater Europe”; Europe, the “core” or “Inside,” is “progressive, always superior” (Blaut 2000, 6). The danger with this “tunnel history” is not only that it lends itself easily to “false claims by Europeans that their society or region is, or was in the past, or always has been and always will be, superior to other societies or regions,” (Blaut 2000, 4), but, worse, that it is viewed as objective historical truth.

Eurocentrism, while as ancient as the concept of Europe as a place itself, has evolved over time. Christians in early medieval times understood that their Islamic neighbors were more advanced than they in technology, wealth, and other institutions but believed they were superior “in the most important way of all: they had the greater hope of being admitted to heaven”  (Blaut 2000, 4). Early Eurocentrism had strong religious overtones; Columbus’ discovery of America in 1492 added a more material level of European superiority. Blaut explains that Columbus reported great potential profits from America’s inferior, easily conquerable people, and when Europeans accumulated wealth in the 1500s, “[they] could now, for the first time on a significantly large scale, make a clear distinction between themselves and a non-European people” (Blaut 2000, 4). Eurocentrism of much of the past 500 years was the naturally accepted European view of the world order; Europeans simply were superior.

The First Explanations of Western Superiority
---------------------------------------------

Max Weber, the great German social scientist of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and one of the founders of scientific sociology, was among the first to analyze the causes of European superiority. In his famous book *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, originally composed in German in 1905, Weber claims that many important modern institutions are uniquely European, criticizing earlier achievements, particular those of China and India:

> Only in the West does science exist at a stage of development which we recognize today as valid... the full development of a systematic theology must be credited to Christianity under the influence of Hellenism, since there were only fragments in Islam and in a few Indian sects... in Babylonia and elsewhere astronomy lacked...the mathematical foundation which it first received from the Greeks. The Indian geometry had no rational proof; that was another product of the Greek intellect, also the creator of mechanics and physics. The Indian natural sciences...lacked the method of experiment, which was, apart from beginnings in antiquity, essentially a product of the Renaissance, as was the modern laboratory. Hence medicine, especially in India, though highly developed in empirical technique, lacked a biological and particularly a biochemical foundation. A rational chemistry has been absent from all areas of culture except the West.
>
> The highly developed historical scholarship of China did not have the method of Thucydides...all Indian political thought was lacking in a systematic method comparable to that of Aristotle, and, indeed, in the possession of rational concepts. Not all the anticipations in India (School of Mimamsa), nor the extensive codification especially in the Near East, nor all the Indian and other books of law, had the strictly systematic forms of thought, so essential to a rational jurisprudence, of the Roman law and of the Western law under its influence. A structure like the canon law is known only to the West. (Weber 1950 13-14)

In Weber’s estimation, the modern sciences are a European achievement, as Babylonian astronomy and Indian geometry, science, and medicine were inferior because they lacked fundamental aspects, and, similarly, Chinese history, Indian political thought, and previous systems of law were not as methodical as history, politics and law in the West. Moreover, while he concedes that “[c]apitalism existed in China, India, Babylon, in the classic world, and in the Middle Ages,” he argues that modern capitalism requires “this particular ethos [which] was lacking” (Weber 1950, 52); capitalism in the true sense of the word is a product of the Protestant ethic of hard work as a calling and material success as its reward, and hence uniquely Western. According to Weber, all modern science, politics, law, and capitalism were developed by the superior West.

The West’s supremacy, Weber contends, suggests the question: “to what combination of circumstances the fact should be attributed that in Western civilization, and in Western civilization only, cultural phenomena have appeared which [have] *universal* significance and value[?]” (Weber 1950, 13). Weber believes that there is one origin to modernity, and capitalism in particular, which will diffuse throughout the rest of the world, as he writes, “In order that a manner of life so well adapted to the peculiarities of capitalism could be selected at all, i.e. should come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to whole groups of men” (Weber 1950, 55). He is the first in a long line of diffusionists who contend that “most humans are imitators, not inventors,” and so change derives from innovations being spread from one place to another (Blaut 1993, 11); these diffusionists believe that “Europeans are more inventive, more innovative than everyone else” (Blaut 1993, 13). Europeans have the key to modernity and, in time, their innovations will extend throughout the rest of the world.

This key, according to Weber, is “West European rationalism” (Weber 1950, 248); this is the underlying cause of European superiority and inventiveness which “determines an important part of the ideals of life of modern bourgeois society” (Weber 1950, 75). Modern European institutions arise largely due to the “methodically rationalized ethical conduct” (Weber 1950, 125) that is unique to “European rationalism,” and its religion in particular. For example, Protestantism was highly influential in the development of capitalism, as he asserts, “The idea of a man’s duty to his possessions, to which he subordinates himself as an obedient steward, or even as an acquisitive machine, bears with chilling weight on his life... it was in the ethic of ascetic Protestantism that [this way of life] first found a consistent ethical foundation. Its significance for the development of capitalism is obvious” (Weber 1950, 170). In other words, the Protestant ethic encourages the growth of business because it encourages its believers to reinvest their profits rather than squander them on worldly pleasures. Additionally, modern specialization and division of labor are attributable to “the emphasis on the ascetic importance of a fixed calling” (Weber 1950, 163). According to Weber, it is the West’s inherent advantage, namely “European rationality,” that accounts for the development of modern institutions.

The German socialist revolutionary and historian Karl Marx also understands capitalism as a distinctive Western innovation, and he stresses that it affords Europeans sustained material growth and thereby power and ascendancy. However, while Weber holds European development of modernity and capitalism in high esteem, Marx also sees exploitation and oppression, as he writes in his and Engel’s famous *Communist Manifesto*, originally published in 1848: “[V]eiled by religious and political illusions, [the European bourgeoisie] has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation” (Marx and Engels 1906, 16). Marx points to the discovery of the Americas as the catalyst for capitalism:

Marx commends Europeans for the development of modern industry and the progress it brought forth, despite the “brutal exploitation” involved. In the first volume of *Capital*, originally published in 1869, Marx writes about the unethical practices that fueled the development of the modern world market, such as “the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins,” yet he praises them because they “signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations, with the globe for a theatre” (Marx 1906, 823). While capitalism involves exploitation, Marx understands this to be a necessary expense for the development of the modern world.

Writing a dispatch to the *New York Daily Tribune* as its London-based correspondent in 1853, Marx expresses condescension towards India, depicting it as a primitive, inferior country: “We must not forget that these idyllic village-communities, inoffensive though they may appear, had...restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition, enslaving it beneath traditional rules, depriving it of all grandeur and historical energies” (Marx 1853, 5). Justifying “British Rule in India,” he writes that the British “dissolved these small semi-barbarian, semi-civilized communities, by blowing up their economical basis, and thus produced the greatest, and to speak the truth, the only social revolution ever heard of in Asia” (Marx 1853, 5). Marx understands India to be inferior to Europe but acknowledges that “the crimes of England” were instrumental in Britain’s role as the “tool of history in bringing about that revolution” (Marx 1853, 5). Disagreeing with Weber, he argues that the new world-market the British induced, far from demonstrating their ethical superiority, was in fact conceived in immorality.

Marx claims that India is not the only beneficiary of British culture and capitalism; he maintains that Europe will force the rest of the world to modernize for its own good:

> The [European] bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt all the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into the midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image. (Marx and Engels 1906, 18-19)

Like Weber, Marx believes in diffusionism, that Britain’s superior mode of commerce will spread throughout the world, yet he recognizes that other nations may not want to accept modernity and that exploitation and oppression are very much a part of the spread of capitalism and the West’s consequent rise to power.


“The Alphabet Effect”
---------------------

Under the influence of the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the resulting condemnation of unfairness and racism, Eurocentric arguments updated Weber’s racist claims of “European rationality” and suggested more socially acceptable versions. A late-20th-century Eurocentric argument that recasts racist Weberian rationality is the “alphabet effect,” coined by Robert Logan in his 1986 book. This argument builds on the communication theory of Harold Innis, a Canadian political economist, who claims in his book *Empire and Communications*, originally published in 1950, that “the subject of communication...occupies a crucial position in the organization and administration of governments and in turn of empires and of Western civilization” (Innis 2007, 23). As Robert Babe summarizes in his book on major scholars of communication theory, Innis believes that “changes in the mode of communication lie at the heart of social, cultural, and economic evolution” (Babe 2000, 60); the way civilizations communicate reflects and, in turn, influences their nature and developments.

While Innis admits that “[i]t would be presumptuous to suggest that the written or the printed word has determined the course of civilizations” (Innis 2007, 27), he credits modes of communication as at least partially responsible for many Western advancements and institutions. For example, he attributes much of Ancient Greece’s success to both the spoken and the written word. “Greek civilization,” he writes, “was a reflection of the power of the spoken word” (Innis 2007, 78). Moreover, the Greeks had a “rich oral tradition” which was not only responsible for many of their achievements but “became the basis of Western culture” (Innis 2007, 106). Furthermore, the West’s superior military has its roots in writing, as Innis asserts: “The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power” (Innis 2007, 30). Additionally, he argues, media influence politics; materials emphasize either time (such as clay or stone) or space (such as papyrus and paper), and media that emphasize time are beneficial for decentralized and hierarchical governmental institutions, whereas media that emphasize space tend towards centralized and more hierarchical political systems. Thus Europe’s superior political structure can be viewed as the natural outgrowth of its mode of communication, as can its early trading economy, because light and durable paper lends itself naturally to trade (Innis 2007, 26-27). What’s more, the very fact of writing radically altered the human mind:

> Men were given an artificially extended and verifiable memory of objects and events not present to sight or recollection. Individuals applied their minds to symbols rather than things and went beyond the world of concrete experience into the world of conceptual relations created within an enlarged time and space universe. The time world was extended beyond the range of remembered things and the space world beyond the range of known places. Writing enormously enhanced a capacity for abstract thinking which had been evident in the growth of language in the oral tradition. Names in themselves were abstractions. Man’s activities and powers were roughly extended in proportion to the increased use and perfection of written records. (Innis 2007, 30)

The West’s use of writing afforded it greater capacity for memory and thinking, and thus, Innis bluntly insists, “the Roman empire and the city-states were essentially products of writing” (Innis 2007, 30); the West’s preeminence can be traced to its modes of communication. Babe adds that Innis’ understanding of communication media also includes modes of transportation, which were similarly influential in the development of civilizations (Babe 2000, 59). In this way, Innis’ theory implies many traditional Eurocentric arguments; however, Babe explains, he also “emphasized bidirectional causations,” which enabled him to avoid “determinism while at the same time affirming the influence on society of changes in the dominant mode of communication” (Babe 2000, 61). In this way, Innis’ arguments cleverly incorporate the spirit of “European rationalism,” while disguising its implicit racism.

Marshall McLuhan, a Canadian communication theorist who coined the saying, “The medium is the message,” and Robert Logan, a media ecologist who collaborated with McLuhan at the University of Toronto, sharpen Innis’ argument by claiming that the West’s phonetic alphabet was superior to the other two types of writing, logographic (or pictographic), in which each word has its own sign, and syllabic, in which each syllable has its own sign (Logan 1986, 20), and distinguishes it from other civilizations that also tapped into the power of the written word; “Phonetic writing was essential to the intellectual development in the West. No such development occurred in the East” (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 375). What distinguishes the phonetic alphabet is that it is “the most economical, with the fewest number of signs, and hence is the most abstract” (Logan 1977, 21), and, because of “these hidden lessons of the alphabet that are not contained [in] the Chinese writing system..., [t]he use of the phonetic alphabet helps to explain why Western and Chinese thinking are so different” (Logan 1986, 21-22). Indeed, he claims, “Eastern and Western thought patterns are as polarized as their respective writing systems” (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 374). Logan attributes the development of Western thought and innovations, including science, formal logic, monotheism, philosophy, psychology, history, political science, law, individualism, rationality, technology, and the Industrial Revolution, all to the fact that the West uses a phonetic alphabet (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 374, 376, and 379, and Logan 1986, 206). This is the essence of the “alphabet effect”; the phonetic alphabet and its “intellectual by-products,” which include “abstraction, analysis, rationality, and classification” (Logan 1986, 21), are at the core of the West’s supremacy.

Logan explains that the advanced, abstract Western way of thinking derives from the phonetic alphabet’s involvement of complex skills: a writer must be able to “1) code and decode, 2) convert auditory signals or sounds into visual signs, 3) think deductively, 4) classify information, and 5) order words through the process of alphabetization” (Logan 1986, 21); therefore, using the phonetic alphabet pushes Westerners to think in a unique way. Logan traces the development of the phonetic alphabet from the Semitic tribe the Seirites (or Midianites or Kennites) to the Phoenicians and Hebrews to the Greeks, who “converted it into a truly phonetic alphabet with the inclusion of vowels. So enriched, the Greek alphabet spread to other cultures and became the basis of all modern Western alphabets, including our own,” and thus, “the alphabet was invented once, and only once, in the history of man” (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 375-376). The modern phonetic alphabet and the unique way of thinking it produces is a Western innovation.

Logan explains how many modern innovations arose naturally out of the alphabet. Unlike other Eurocentric scholars, such as White, McLuhan and Logan recognize that the Chinese had “greater technological sophistication” as they were “the inventors of metallurgy, irrigation systems, animal harnesses, paper, ink, printing, movable type, gunpowder, rockets, porcelain, and silk”; however, “the abstract, logical, systematic thought” that the alphabet promotes “explains why science began in the West and not the East” (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 375). Logan additionally explains that writing allows for the subject matter to have an identity distinct from its author, and so “The Greeks through writing developed a notion of objectivity—the separation of the knower from the object of his study. This is the beginning of the scientific method and the source of the dichotomy the Greeks created between subjective and objective thinking” (Logan 1986, 107). Moreover, Logan and McLuhan claim, “The alphabet separated and isolated visual space from the many other kinds of sensory space involved in the senses of smell, touch, kinesthesia, and acoustics” which allowed for the development of Euclidean geometry (McLuhan and Logan 1977, 380). Additionally, formal logic follows from “The linking together of the elements of the alphabet, the letters, to form words, [which] provided a model for the linking together of ideas to form a logical argument” (Logan 1986, 109). Finally, Logan claims that the thought process involved in stringing together letters, and the revolutionary printing press “where the repeatable uniform type fonts were used and reused in an infinite number of permutations,” influenced, “inspired” even, the engineers and inventors of the Industrial Revolution, who based “piecing together the repeatable uniform elements of gears, screws, and levers in linear configurations to achieve specific mechanical tasks” on “the same principles” (Logan 1986, 206). By tracing modern innovations to the Western alphabet and the unique thinking it involves, Logan and McLuhan strengthen Innis’ claims that the West is better due to their modes of communication.

Critics of the alphabet effect dispute many of the connections between innovations and the alphabet that these theorists infer. The British social anthropologist Jack Goody asserts, “It is a gross ethnocentric error of Europe to attribute too much to the alphabet and too much to the West” (Goody 1993, 56). He explains that societies using logographic systems have the same potential as Western civilizations using the phonetic alphabet; indeed, China had similar developments in new ways of knowing and disciplines and “great advances in the accumulation, transmission and furthering of knowledge were made using this system [with] brush and paper” (Goody 1993, 56). Goody does not deny the achievements of Europe throughout the past 500 years, yet he observes that many scholars are “mistaken in placing the weight of the explanation on features that were neither confined to the West nor always critical to the growth of industrial capitalism. It was ethnocentric bias that saw them as unique” (Goody 1996, 246). While the alphabet effect theory provides a basis for claiming that the West is inherently superior without being overtly racist, its links between the invention of language and all the innovations that followed are at best speculative and at worst pseudoscientific and false.


Traditional 20th Century Eurocentric Historians
-----------------------------------------------

The majority of traditional 20th century Eurocentric historians shifted away from Weber’s racism, on the one hand, and Marx’s understanding of the negative exploitation involved, on the other. They tended to focus on the positive of West’s unique culture and environment, which they claimed determined its superiority early on, although “rationality” still underlies many of their suppositions. The medieval historian and specialist in the history of technology Lynn White, Jr. argues for technological determinism: the West’s rise is due to its uniquely inventive culture and the resulting technological innovations it developed in medieval times. Because of their distinctive ingenuity, derived from the Judeo-Christian religion and tradition, Europeans in the High Middle Ages invented revolutionary technology that allowed them to advance to feudalism and then to capitalism and modernity.

Just as Weber’s arguments revolved around “European rationality,” White similarly understands Europeans to be uniquely inventive, but he disguises the racism by focusing on the specific technological advancements that set Europe on its path of global domination. White argues that the agricultural revolution revolves around three European technological advances: (1) the heavy plow, (2) the horse collar, and thereby the use of horse power, and (3) the “three-field system” of rotating crops (White 1962). White claims that “in Northern Europe, and there alone” the innovation of the heavy plow allowed peasants to utilize the land fully. White claims, “No more fundamental change in the idea of man’s relation to the soil can be imagined: once man had been a part of nature; now he became her exploiter.... Man and nature are now two things, and man is master” (White 1962, 56-57). Similarly, the development of a harness, used with the nailed horseshoe, revolutionized the horse as “an economic as well as a military asset” (White 1962, 57). Finally, the “three-field system” of rotating crops increased “the numbers and prowess of horses” (White 1962, 75) and, due to the new profusion and variety of food, “goes far toward explaining...the startling expansion of population, the growth and multiplication of cities, the rise in industrial production, the outreach of commerce, and the new exuberance of spirits which enlivened that age” (White 1962, 76). According to White, these particular innovations arose because of European inventiveness, and, thus, Europe was long destined to rise to ascendancy and had begun to do so already in medieval times.

Another 20th century Eurocentric historian, Eric Jones, wrote *The European Miracle* in 1981, which, in Blaut’s characterization, “advances the unqualified argument that Europe has at all times in history been superior to all other civilizations in all dimensions of culture relevant to economic development, to progress, to modernization” (Blaut 2000, 75). Jones calls Europe an “aberration” that was “innovative” and “stable” and dedicates his book to understanding this “miracle” (Jones 2003, 225). Jones summarizes his thesis as follows:

> Europe, or rather Western or north-western Europe, was a minor region that generated economic growth when other, larger societies did not. Rare moves in that direction by the great empires of the ancient and oriental world all lapsed. Moreover, fruitful economic change in Europe predated the industrial revolution, which, rather than being the start of growth, emerged from a long past. The continent’s advantages and achievements were varied and cumulative. (Jones 2003, 239)

Jones’ argument has many layers: the Industrial Revolution was undoubtedly a uniquely European phenomenon, yet Europe’s advantage predates the Industrial Era, thanks to the continent’s inherent cultural and environmental advantages. At the right time, “Europe underwent political, technological, and geographical upheavals which were to make it the birthplace of the industrial world” (Jones 2003, 225), whereas other civilizations’ “rare moves” to follow suit were sporadic and, overall, fruitless.

Jones opens his book by asserting that Europe was endowed with unique environmental “gifts” and that non-Europeans were irrational, “insensate,” for squandering resources on “multiplication of the common life,” for allowing uncontrolled growth of their populations (Jones 2003, 3). Controlling its population allowed Europe to avoid Malthusian catastrophes and advance its society. George Huppert claims that, after the black death, about 90 percent of nubile girls outside of Western Europe married and conceived, whereas only 67 percent, and in the seventeenth century 55 percent, did so in England; as such, “European peasants adapted to scarce resources by limiting potential births by as much as 50 percent” (Huppert 1998, 13). Huppert extends Jones’ argument that this contributed to Western dominance, claiming: “Delayed marriage may have been the most important element within the social system created by European peasants after the fourteenth century.... European peasants set a course that separated them from the rest of the world’s inhabitants” (Huppert 1998, 13). The stagnation of non-Western societies is due to an inability to control their sexual urges. According to Jones and other scholars, where “copulation was preferred over commodities” (Jones 2003, 15) in the non-European world, delayed marriage as a form of birth control prevented unsupportable population growth and is one of the many factors that contributed to the West’s rise to power.

A main part of Jones’ argument is Europe’s environmental determinism, which, Blaut asserts, “plays a crucial role in Eurocentric distortions of history. [Environmental determinism theories] falsely claim that the natural environment of Europe is superior [in] that it has led Europeans to progress further or faster than other peoples, who supposedly occupy inferior environments” (Blaut 2000, 149). Jones claims that part of what makes Europe’s environment superior is its climate: in his view, “combined ill-health, heat and malnutrition in the tropics have been shown to cut labor productivity per man by up to eighty-seven per cent, besides raising absentee rates” (Jones 2003, 7). Moreover, Europe’s “high, even rainfall and passable summers” was advantageous for producing varied crops, which in turn gave Europeans nutritional “advantages over the cereal diets of the older civilisations” (Jones 2003, 48-49). While Asia’s irrigated soils were more productive than Europe’s rain-fed soils, Jones turns this into another argument for European superiority, as it “freed a fraction of European energies for other purposes,” so Europeans “spent less time on all aspects of farmwork than [Asians] spent on water control work alone” (Jones 2003, 8). Additionally, because of the lack of irrigation and naturally large fields and pastures, farming did not require complex interactions of many people, and so Europeans scattered and lived in dispersed settlements. This made it hard for a ruler to control them, and thus they retained freedom; Jones calls this “Europeanness [which] lies in the form of the original settlement history” (Jones 2003, 13). Furthermore, the environment was “more conducive to regional specialisation than many regions of the earth” (Jones 2003, 239); as such, the environment led to economic diversity and advantage. Jones also disparages the East for worsening its environment: “Faeces discharged into water made China the world reservoir of lung, liver, and intenstinal flukes and the Oriental schistosome, all serious causes of chronic illness” (Jones 2003, 6-7). Not only did Europeans capitalize on the natural advantages of their environment, but non-Europeans also compounded their disadvantages by worsening their-already inferior environment.

Jones’ argument represents a shift from the traditional Eurocentric arguments of advantage based on inherently superior culture by emphasizing Europe’s environment as a key cause; however, he falls back on culture, particularly Europe’s “peculiarly inventive society” (Jones 2003, 227), as the other main factor that contributed to its upper hand. Like White, he believes that, on “the technological front, the history of Europe [looks] like a persistent drifting advance...compared with the sluggish nature of other civilisations” (Jones 2003, 56). White focuses more on specific technological advances, whereas Jones does not hesitate to remind his readers that “Europe was a mutant civilisation in its uninterrupted amassing of knowledge about technology” (Jones 2003, 45) and that “ceaseless tinkering is a defining characteristic of [European] culture” (Jones 2003, 62). Additionally, he claims, “other societies seem to have spent their leisure single-mindedly in pursuit of pleasure or at best in impractical philosophising,” so Europe’s technological prowess “is not so surprising” (Jones 2003, 63-64). Jones’ arguments about Europe’s “traditionally inventive economy” (Jones 2003, 59) hearken back to Weber’s thesis of “European rationality,” but by combining them with environmental determinism, he softens the racist undertones and strengthens his overall argument.

John A. Hall, a historical sociologist, adopts a hybrid explanation that borrows from the theories of many of his predecessors and contemporaries. On the one hand, he argues along the lines of environmental determinism, but on the other, he supports Weberian “rationality.” He additionally argues for the advantage conferred upon Europe by the *laissez-faire* approach of Christianity, compared to the intrusiveness of other religions in other locations on the development of political institutions and scientific advances. Like Jones, he claims that Europe’s environment and geography stimulated its predominance. The continent of Europe, he asserts, “is a divided area with several small cores, the majority of which have deep and productive clay soils fed by rainfall. There was no need for irrigation. It is quite likely that this encouraged, or at least allowed for, a decentred agricultural civilisation based on individual initiative” (Hall 1986, 111). Hall believes that Europe’s environment was a contributing factor in its superiority, and this grounds his thesis in “objectivity”; however, he believes, like many scholars of his time still do, that, underlying the other factors, “Unquestionably, rationalisation is one of the key concepts of the modern social sciences” (Hall 1986, 150). He also borrows Jones’ and Huppert’s argument about the benefits of moderate population growth, claiming that, unlike in China, “improvements in output were not eaten up by a massive growth in population” (Hall 1986, 131), and so the environmental advantages were not wasted. Moreover, while Hall recognizes that other societies made major technological advances, he does not hesitate to import White’s technological determinism, although he modifies it slightly: “This society showed considerable skill at invention...and even more at adopting and adapting inventions which it borrowed from Islam and China” (Hall 1986, 122). Like scholars before and after him, Hall believes that Europe’s environment and culture inherently made it better.

Hall adds a *laissez-faire* argument in relation to science and politics: not only is Europe inherently better on account of all the factors cited above, but other civilizations, due to their philosophical and theological belief systems, actively interfered with the development of modern institutions. “Rational science,” he writes, “was to some extent blocked in other world civilizations” (Hall 1986, 133), and “Christianity provided the best shell for the emergence of states” (Hall 1986, 135) and “differs from Islam [and] Hinduism, since it did not ‘block’ politics, and so did not encourage a climate of instability which limited the autonomy of market relationships” (Hall 1986, 143). Therefore, Hall contends, “only in Europe did the city gain full autonomy,” and this “ensured the ultimate success of the market principle... We live in the world created by this civilisation” (Hall 1986, 136). Blaut contemptuously dismisses his argument as “basically a synthesis of the theories of Weber, White, and Jones...a sociological stewpot” (Blaut 2000, 146) and is “thus another eclectic theory of the ‘European miracle,’ intended to get maximum support from a multiplicity of Eurocentric arguments” (Blaut 2000, 128).

Following in the footsteps of Weber, White, Jones, Hall, and many other scholars, the economic historian David Landes asserts classical Eurocentric arguments in his popular book *The Wealth and Poverty of Nations*, originally published in 1998. “Some would say that Eurocentrism is bad for us, indeed bad for the world, hence to be avoided,” he writes in his introduction. “Those people should avoid it. As for me, I prefer truth to goodthink” (Landes 1999, xxi). Landes openly acknowledges and embraces his Eurocentrism, claiming it to be the truth. Contemptuously, he likens historians who are “confronted with a near terminal [sic.] case of cultural superiority” to masters who want to comfort their pets: “[t]he historian is tempted to play the role of comforter and to stroke the object of his affections as the master a pet. That’s all right for pets, which don’t have to grow up, but not for countries, which do” (Landes 2006, 21). Landes accuses historians of writing history as a comfort story, covering up what he views as the truth; Europe has inherent qualities of superiority, but also, as he recognizes that European superiority was not entirely predestined, China is partially to blame for its own inferiority.

In addition to China’s culpability, Landes’ arguments hinge on environmental determinism and cultural superiority. “Geography, in short,” Landes asserts, “brings bad tidings” (Landes 1999, 5) to many countries and is instrumental in disadvantaging the rest of the world. He echoes earlier historians’ environmental determinism, arguing that most undeveloped countries are in tropical regions, whereas rich countries tend to be in temperate zones (Lanes 1999, 5), and, of course, there are “far more favorable conditions in temperate zones; and within these, in Europe above all; and within Europe, in western Europe first and foremost” (Landes 1999, 17). Some of the advantages Europe’s superior environment confers upon it include the ability to grow crops throughout the year (Landes 1999, 14) and “warm winds and gentle rain, water in all seasons, and low rates of evaporation” (Landes 1999, 18). Non-Europeans were not blessed with such good luck, and their environment in fact *discourages* progress; in tropic regions, the “damp, ‘sweaty’ climes reduce the cooling effect of perspiration,” Landes argues, and “the easiest way to reduce this...problem is not to generate heat; in other words, keep still and don’t work” (Landes 1999, 6). Therefore, simply because of differences in climate, non-Europeans are discouraged from productivity, and thus Europeans are more productive.

In addition to environmental determinism, Landes believes in cultural superiority: “If we learn anything from economic development, it is that culture makes all the difference. (Here Max Weber was right on)” (Landes 1999, 516). He further agrees with Weber that Protestantism developed “a new kind of man—rational, ordered, diligent and productive” (Landes 1999, 177). Like White, he believes this manifests itself in technological innovativeness, and Europe in medieval times was “one of the most inventive societies that history had known” (Landes 1999, 45). China, on the other hand, had an “atmosphere of routine, of traditionalism, and of immobility, which makes any innovation suspect, any initiative that is not commanded and sanctioned in advance.” Consequently, China’s culture was “unfavorable to the spirit of free inquiry” (Landes 2006, 8). The government “stifled dissent and innovation, even technological innovation. This was a culturally and intellectually homeostatic society,” Landes claims, and whenever “change threatened the status quo, the state would step in and restore order” (Landes 1999, 38). In the conclusion of his 2006 paper explaining why China did not rise to power, Landes asks, “Imperial China open-minded, curious? No way” (Landes 1999, 21). Similarly, while Muslims made many advances prior to 1100 CE, and was, in fact “Europe’s teacher,” at that point “something went wrong” and their progress was halted. “Islamic science, denounced as heresy by religious zealots, bent under theological pressures for spiritual conformity,” Landes writes in a chapter about Islam entitled “History Gone Wrong” (Landes 1999, 54).

Not only did the Europeans invent many advanced technologies, but, even more remarkably, “the very notion of economic development was a Western invention” (Landes 1999, 32); Landes posits that Europe’s economy was destined to be advanced on account of Western culture and values, irrespective of other assets from which it benefited. When Columbus discovered the New World, this advanced economy was able to grow into a world market. China did not discover the Americas because of the inferiority of its people. “Why did China not make that little extra effort that would have taken it around the southern end of Africa and up into the Atlantic?” Landes asks. “Chinese lacked range, focus, and above all, curiosity...They could find what they wanted in the Indian Ocean, and what they wanted was so trivial that it was not an appetizer but a dessert” (Landes 1999, 96). According to Landes, the Chinese were too simple-minded for grand explorations like Columbus’. He assigns further blame to China, “the one civilization that was in a position to match and even anticipate the European achievement”; not only was it naturally too uninquisitive, but, when China had two chances to rise to power with science and technology, it wasted them: first, to have its own scientific and industrial revolution based on its past technological achievements, and, second, to adopt Western science and thus still advance itself when Europeans, who they regrettably viewed as “foreign ‘barbarians,’” entered their region (Landes 2006, 5). Landes writes that China had a “policy of superior indifference to Western things” (Landes 2006, 18); China was intimidated by the West’s “ebullience and excitement, its urgency and competitiveness, its brutal commitment to truth and efficacy [which] went against the Chinese mindset” (Landes 2006, 17). He cites a specific example which captures this mindset of false superiority impeding Chinese advancement; when the British asked China for trading rights and a permanent legation to be stationed at its capital, the Qienlong emperor wrote to George III, “We have never set much store on strange and ingenious objects, nor do we need any more of your country’s manufactures” (Landes 2006, 18). China was self-satisfied and aloof, and, thus, “China failed both times” it had the chance to rise to power (Landes 2006, 5).

Finally, Landes concludes, “the hinge of this metamorphosis” that cemented Europe’s supremacy “was the Industrial Revolution begun in Britain in the 18th century and emulated around the world” (Landes 1999, 168). Here, Landes’ belief in diffusionism is evident: Europe is the best in many ways and the rest of the world has or will follow in its footsteps as it advances. He asserts that there are three factors that “made the Industrial Revolution”: “(1) the substitution of machines—rapid, regular, precise, tireless—for human skill and effort; (2) the substitution of inanimate for animate sources of power... thereby opening an almost endless supply of energy; and (3) the use of far more abundant raw materials... These substitutions...yielded a rapid rise in productivity, and, with it, in income per head” (Landes 1999, 186). This pivotal event in the chronicle of Europe’s increasing dominance is only natural, considering Europe’s superior culture; it had been “well on its way to the Industrial Revolution” for centuries, having “long since passed Asia by” (Landes 1999, 165). However, Landes seems also to fault the rest of the world for not being the site of the Industrial Revolution: “some countries made an industrial revolution and became rich; others did not and stayed poor,” he observes (Landes 1999, 168). He concludes, “Over the thousand and more years of…progress…the key factor—the driving force—has been Western civilization and its dissemination: the knowledge, the techniques, the political and social ideologies” (Landes 1999, 513); modernity is attributable to Europe’s superiority, which was determined by its environment and Protestant culture.

Jared Diamond is an extreme environmental determinist; “Environment molds history,” he writes (Diamond 1997, 352). He believes that Europe’s superiority can be traced even to the orientation of the axes of the three main land-masses, Eurasisa, Africa, and the Americas; the “fortunes of history” (Diamond 1997, 191) hinged on whether the axes were north-to-south or east-to-west, as this had a major effect on the spread of crops, technology, and other inventions; axis orientation had “enormous, sometimes tragic consequences” for world history (Diamond 1997, 176). Eurasia is 8,000 miles wide on its east-west axis and 3,000 miles at its widest on its north-south axis, whereas the Americas span 9,000 miles north-south and a mere 40 miles east-west at the Isthmus of Panama, and Africa is similarly longer than it is wide (Diamond 1997, 176). Diamond draws these axes on the following map (Diamond 1997, 177):

<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="/assets/imgs/diamond1.png" alt="" style="">
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg"></div>

Diamond maintains, “Axis orientations affected the rate of spread of crops and livestock, and possibly also of writing, wheels, and other inventions” (Diamond 1997, 176), and so societies that arose in Eurasia, where the axis is east-west, became more prosperous and successful than those in the Americas, where the axis is north-south. For example, Eurasia’s east-west axis allowed for the rapid spread of crops because the crops were adapted to that latitude. In contrast, plants spread more slowly between north and south, even across short distances; when a plant has been genetically programmed to a particular latitude, it will resist diseases, so transplanting to the north or to the south causes many complications for a farmer because the plant isn’t adapted to the climate, ecology, and diseases at the new latitude. Indirectly related to the phenomena involved in the spread of crops, Diamond adds that the wheel and writing spread east-west across Eurasia while they never spread south from Mexico to the Andes. Crop production creates a society in which these inventions are needed to expand the economy and sustain the social system associated with these crops. From the moment the orientation of the continents was set, Eurasia was given an environmental head-start (Diamond 1997, 176-191).

Axis orientation is only the beginning; Diamond summarizes his argument for the rise of the West in the following flow chart of “ultimate factors” that explain “the broadest patterns of history” and “proximate factors,” which result from the “ultimate factors” (Diamond 1997, 87):

<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="/assets/imgs/diamond2.png" alt="" style="">
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg"></div>

In this chart, Diamond amalgamates many traditional Eurocentric arguments under the banner of environmental determinism; a potpourri of crops, societal and political organization, writing, exploration, and technology all make their way into his argument. However, as a consequence of his geographic argument regarding axis orientations, many of these factors apply to Eurasia as a whole, that is, equally to Europe and Asia, so Diamond explains that the “proximate factors behind Europe’s rise [are] its development of a merchant class, capitalism, and patent protection for inventions, its failure to develop absolute despots and crushing taxation, and its Graeco-Judeo-Christian tradition of empirical inquiry” (Diamond 1997, 410). Marx’s capitalism, Weber’s rationality, and White’s technological determinism are all incorporated in Diamond’s environmental determinism. By building up from simple observations about differences in environment and the very shape of the continents, Diamond masks conventional Eurocentrism and conveys seemingly objective facts about Europe’s naturally determined superiority.

Scholars of the 20th century who tried to analyze the causes of the West’s dominance tended to posit Eurocentric arguments of inherent superiority, whether in culture, in environment, or both. However, they disavowed Weber’s overt racism in favor of more subdued claims of superior culture, or disguised versions of it, and environmental determinism became increasingly popular, as it allowed for seemingly objective, factual, and non-racist explanations of the inevitability of Europe’s rise to ascendancy.


Eurocentric World History Textbooks
-----------------------------------

Just as academic scholarship on the rise of the West originated with narrowly conceived Eurocentrism, world history textbooks in the United States also used to be very focused on Europeans and their uniqueness, with non-Europeans playing a peripheral role in the sweep of historical narrative. “Textbooks are an important window into a culture,” Blaut posits. “[M]ore than just books, they are semiofficial statements of exactly what the opinion-forming elite of the culture want the educated youth of that culture to believe to be true about the past and present world” (Blaut 1993, 6). He goes on to explain that many textbooks written in the early 20th century were written in the style of “tunnel history,” similar to scholarship of the early 20th century, in which historical causes were almost exclusively European, and their effects were diffused throughout the rest of the world. Even afterwards, once historical scholarship had become more inclusive and balanced, the pro-Western bias of textbooks continued to prevail, because textbooks are slow to adopt new topics and ideas.

On Columbia University’s website *Asia for Educators*, Kenneth Pomeranz and Bin Wong, in their web module about China and Europe throughout the past 500 years and the meaning of modernity, quote numerous textbooks that focus on Europe or frame Asia in a less-than-positive light. For example, Paul Thomas Welty and Miriam Greenblatt’s fourth edition of *The Human Expression*, a world history textbook for middle school students, asserts:

> Basic cultural differences existed between the Chinese and Western Europeans. To Westerners, the individual was more important than the group. The Chinese took the opposite view. Westerners believed in the supremacy of law. The Chinese believed in an all-powerful emperor. Westerners placed a high value on technology and material wealth. The Chinese considered proper relationships far more important. [Additionally,] while Westerners held merchants and business people in high regard, the Chinese tended to despise merchants, who ‘neither plow nor weed.’ (Welty and Greenblatt 1992, 234 in Pomeranz and Wong 2004, “What Do We Mean By *Modern*?”)

This textbook explanation hearkens back to the Weberian logic of European rationality, or at the least the Eurocentric argument of cultural determinism; Westerners alone believed in individualism, and thus they were economically progressive (as Marx claimed) and technologically oriented and advanced (White).

Another textbook, Rhoads Murphey’s third edition of *East Asia: A New History*, intended for college students, whose title suggests a balanced approach that appreciates the contributions of non-Western perspectives and cultures, similarly reiterates the Eurocentric orthodoxies that are no longer in vogue among historians:

> There was nothing like the modern Western belief in ‘progress’ and its orientation to the future.... The modern West followed a different course, actively pursuing change in the name of ‘progress,’ attacking nature to get at its secrets, and developing a new science and technology, which in a century or two transformed Western society in the progression from steam and steel and railways to the internal-combustion engine and nuclear power. East Asia did not make this leap, until the Japanese, impressed by new Western power, determined to replicate it for themselves in the last part of the nineteenth century. China, Korea, and Vietnam (the latter by then under French colonial rule) resisted such catastrophic change as disruptive of all their traditional values and moreover as something of despised ‘barbarian’ origin, until their modern humiliation at the hands of the West and Japan drove them finally to pursue fundamental change. (Murphey 2003, 10-11 in Pomeranz and Wong 2004, “What Do We Mean By *Modern*?”)

Not only does this textbook assert that the West was uniquely progressive, but it also describes how the West encouraged other, Eastern civilizations to “make this leap” to modernity, thus diffusing the gifts of its superiority throughout the world. As such, this textbook overtly claims classic Eurocentric diffusionism to be fact.

In the introduction to his book on Islamic history, Afghan-American Tamim Ansary tells a story of personal experience with the Eurocentrism of textbooks. He describes his challenge when hired in 2000 to develop a new world history textbook for a Texas publisher:

> I noticed an interesting tug and pull between my advisors and me. We agreed on almost everything *except*—I kept wanting to give more coverage to Islam in world history.... No one was saying Islam was better or worse than ‘the West.’ All of us were simply expressing our best sense of which events had been most consequential in the story of humankind.
>
> Mine was so much the minority opinion that it was indistinguishable from error, so we ended up with a table of contents in which Islam constituted the central topic of just one out of thirty chapters... If you went strictly by our table of contents, you would never guess Islam still existed. (Ansary 2009, xiv-xv)

Ansary’s experience in developing this high school world history textbook is yet another example of how accepted Eurocentric “tunnel vision” is; the Islamic scholar’s opinion on the importance of Islam to world history was treated as “indistinguishable from error,” and Islam was relegated to the margins of history in the narrative.

The world historian William McNeill wrote his famous *The Rise of the West*: A History of the Human Community as a world history textbook in 1963. It, too, assumed many Eurocentric tenets; McNeill himself realized and publicly acknowledged decades later, “*The Rise of the West* tends to march with big battalions, looking at history from the point of view of the winners—that is, of the skilled and privileged managers of society—and shows scant concern for the sufferings of the victims of historical change” (McNeill 1990, 3).

McNeill writes that the rise of the West began in 1500 after its overseas discoveries, and, he adds, “the career of Western civilization since 1500 appears as a vast explosion, far greater than any comparable phenomenon of the past both in geographic range and in social depth. Incessant and accelerating self-transformation, compounded from a welter of conflicting ideas, institutions, aspirations, and inventions, has characterized modern European history” (McNeill 1991, 567). McNeill describes  previous world systems of trade, though he assesses that they were not as impressive or extensive as the modern world-system. For example, between 1700 and 500 BCE there was trade across Middle East, and in 100 BCE China entered the field of international trade with the Silk Road. In 1000 CE, the rise of Islam revived a world system, and China also traded with the Middle East and borrowed customs (McNeill 1991, 573). However, Europe’s overseas trading and the rise of capitalism “raised European power to a new level of effectiveness and for the first time gave Europeans a clear margin of superiority over the other great civilizations of the world” (McNeill 1991, 578). By the time of the Industrial Revolution, the West was the center of the world market, commandeering all trade, as McNeill shows in the following diagram (McNeill 1991, 727):


<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="/assets/imgs/mcneill1.jpeg" alt="" style="">
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg"></div>

McNeill attributes the rise of the West partly to “the stimuli that flowed into Europe from overseas, but primarily [to] internal tensions arising from its own heterogeneous cultural inheritance” (McNeill 1991, 578); as such, McNeill’s explanation hinges on the narrow view of inherent European superiority. This “History of the Human Community” views world history through “tunnel vision,” with Eurocentric lenses of cultural determinism firmly in place.

In an interview for an educational video segment on the rise of the West, Anand Yang remarks on McNeill’s book, “I remember in graduate school recoiling when I first read McNeill’s *Rise of the West*, but it was really passed off as a world history textbook. It was largely about Europe and Europe’s domination of the world. And coming to it as a South Asian historian, as an Asian historian, I was rather disturbed by an eminent historian passing off the story of Europe as the story of the world” (Yang 2003). McNeill’s *Rise of the West* was more a Eurocentric narrative than a neutral account of world history, and McNeill himself understood this decades later, as he writes in his article about it 25 years after its publication, “*The Rise of the West* should be seen as an expression of the postwar imperial mood in the United States. Its scope and conception is a form of intellectual imperialism, for it takes on the world as a whole, and it tries to understand global history on the basis of cultural diffusion developed among American anthropologists in the 1930s” (McNeill 1990, 1-2). In the same video, McNeill describes the evolution in his understanding of world history:

> [W]hen I wrote The *Rise of the West* I thought in terms of separate civilizations, each with its own sphere of influence. And then interacting, overlapping zones, and movement of ideas back and forth, of technologies back and forth, and skills and organization back and forth. And now I think it’s not untrue, but it seems to be today it’s better to think of the totality of different civilizations lodged within a web—a web of communication and transportation—that means that new experiences, new possibilities, new things can move back and forth perpetually. (McNeill 2004)

In other words, in *The Rise of the West*, McNeill described world trade in terms of individual, distinct civilizations trading with one another which were united more thoroughly when the West assumed the center; however, he realized later, civilizations are actually more dynamically interconnected with one another and world trade is more fluid than he had represented them in his book.

McNeill also realized that Europe’s rise to power necessarily relied upon the rest of the world’s achievements to date, particularly those of China and Islam, as it is only logical that “no population can overtake and then surpass the rest of the world without using the most efficacious and powerful instruments known anywhere on earth” (McNeill 1990, 18). Innovations that had originated in the Middle East were influential in China’s rise in 1000 CE, and so, too, Europe’s rise to power in 1500 CE relied upon “borrowings” from China. “One of the clearest patterns in world history,” McNeill now claims, is that “any geographical displacement of world leadership must be prefaced by successful borrowing from previously established centers of the highest prevailing skills” (McNeill 1990, 18). The civilization that rises to power still deserves credit for successful adoption and adaptation of earlier innovations, yet the rest of the world necessarily plays a role, and their successes are prerequisite to the dominating civilization’s success. McNeill admits that, at the time of writing *The Rise of the West*, he did not understand “[t]he fluctuating growth of this sort of world system, with shifting centers and a great multiplicity of peoples and cultures caught within it [dating] back to the very beginning of civilized history” as so central to world history.


Historical Explanations for Eurocentrism
----------------------------------------

McNeill believes that he, along with all historians, is influenced by the time and place in which he developed his ideas. He explains that as he wrote the book between 1954 and 1963, the United States’ wealth postwar allowed it to influence others, and thus, McNeill admits, “It follows that my vision of the world’s past can be dismissed as being no more than a rationalization of American hegemony, retrojecting the situation of post-World War II decades upon the whole of the world’s past by claiming that analogous patterns of cultural dominance and diffusion had existed always” (McNeill 1990, 2). The West’s power and authority during the time McNeill was writing shaped his understanding of its rise; he made sense of the phenomena by understanding earlier history in a way that supported it. However, McNeill writes that he was “entirely unaware of the way in which my method of making sense of world history conformed to the temporary world experience of the United States” (McNeill 1990, 3), and the positive reception the book received was likely due to the same desire to understand and place current events in the context of world history. In his 2004 video interview, McNeill summarizes his experience of adjusting his understanding of the rise of the West as follows:

> A historian, of course, lives through time himself, and the world changes in the course of a lifetime as long as mine quite drastically—really very drastically so that your awareness, your sensibilities, your expectations, your consciousness will alter if you keep reading and keep listening and keep talking to people...the observer has a platform which is constantly transformed by the very fact that he’s alive...Your sensibilities and what you can see in the world will alter depending on what you’re looking for, and of course history changes as well, so you’re looking back upon a change where these processes were constantly going on. (McNeill 2004)

Scholars’ beliefs and understandings of history are influenced by their *a priori* ideas and their setting, and thus they continuously evolve as the world around them and the body of accepted and socially acceptable scholarship evolve.

In light of this understanding of historiography, Eurocentrism is, unsurprisingly, the product of the life and times of its authors. Where McNeill had post-World War II American wealth and power as the main historical influence on his writings, earlier Eurocentric historians lived through colonialism and imperialism. Historians living during this period understood the beginnings of Europe’s rise as just “one part of a great world-scale diffusion process” (Blaut 1989, 260). The growing evidence of the West’s power influenced scholarship on the rise of the West for two main reasons. First, the expansion was “so swift and so profitable that European superiority seemed almost to be a law of nature” (Blaut 1993, 26), and so the West’s power seemed to have stemmed from some inherent, predetermined cause. Second, the Western intelligentsia desired to explain the expansion in ethical terms, as a way of justifying the violence and oppression that accompanied expansion and distracting themselves from the cries of suffering of their colonial subjects.

Jack Goody explains that historians looking at European advances and its rise to power “inevitably” deemphasized the rest of the world’s achievements and contributions, and so, he writes, there is a “distorting tendency of Europeans to inflate their overall contribution to world society and even to ‘Western civilisation’, a tendency reinforced by their undoubted achievements over the past few centuries” (Goody 1996, 238). European scholars tended to focus on European achievement and superiority and write “tunnel history” because the West was very powerful and expanding as they wrote.

Blaut elaborates on the second way colonialism and imperialism affected historical scholarship. The prevalence and blossoming of Eurocentric arguments in the 20th century, he claims, is partially due to it being “the intellectual and scholarly rationale for one of the most powerful social interests of the European elite.” Indeed, he continues, “justifying and assisting Europe’s colonial activities, has been, and still is, of very great importance. Eurocentrism is quite simply the colonizer’s model of the world” (Blaut 1993, 10). Diffusionist theory provides an ethical framework from which to understand colonialism and imperialism; the West was bestowing upon its colonies gifts of its cultural superiority and modernity. Furthermore, this was a natural process, as modern innovations are meant to diffuse throughout the world, so unethical consequences along the way are excusable. Conquest, expansion, exploitation, oppression, repression—“All of it was right, rational, and natural” (Blaut 1993, 26). In other words, not only were scholars’ theories about the rise of the West attempting to *understand* the rise of the West, answering the question, ‘Why did this occur?’, but they were also attempting to *justify* it, answering, ‘How can we reconcile it with our humanity?’

The civil rights movement was another historical event that influenced explanations of the rise of the West, and it effected a shift in scholars’ approaches to the question. Racism and unfairness were no longer acceptable in society, not least in the academic world, and so Weberian racism had to be toned down or disguised. European rationality was preserved as an argument without appeals to race as a factor, and it was further diluted with environmental determinism. Blaut explains that there is a “long-standing and happy marriage between environmentalism and Eurocentrism,” as, originally, environment was just another way in which God blessed Europeans (Blaut 1999, 391), and, more recently, environmental determinism asserts inherent European superiority in a seemingly factual way that does not need to appeal to Weber’s European rationality. Furthermore, environmentalism is indispensable to Eurocentric scholars, Blaut explains, because, even within the category of culture, “historians cannot agree among themselves as to whether the causes of Europe’s (supposed) precocity are mental, social, economic, technological, or something else” (Blaut 1999, 392). Therefore, “Eurocentric history needs environmental determinism” (Blaut 1999, 392) to both patch up holes in arguments about inherent cultural superiority and detract from its implicit racism. In this transition from the Weberian argument centered on rationality to Diamond’s focus on environmental determinism dating back to continental axis orientation, the civil rights movement played a key role.
